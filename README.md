The Grocery Shopping System is a web-based application developed using HTML and PHP and hosted locally with XAMPP. 
It enables customers to browse products, add items to their cart, make payments, and generate bills, while ensuring that inventory quantities are updated in real time within the database. 
This real-time synchronization helps administrators easily track stock levels, manage inventory efficiently, and generate sales and availability reports, ultimately reducing manual work and improving store operations.
